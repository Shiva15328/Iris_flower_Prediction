Used Multiclass logistic regression algorithm to build the model.
Read the image having verginica, versicolor, setosa.
Given sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width to x, species to y. 
printed the confusion matrix, Accuracy = 1
Based on the the given values of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width we can predict which type of flower it is among the four.
Eg: Predicted for sepal length=4.1, sepal width=1.8, petal length=1.1, petal width=0.8 it is 'Setosa'.
